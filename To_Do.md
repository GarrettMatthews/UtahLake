# To-Do List 
*These are the steps I initially plan to do in this project*
* Create variables for columns of interest
* Compare these columns to look for patterns
* Figure out what data there is
 * Translate the location codes (see location_codes.csv) into physical locations, and then narrow in on Utah lake specifically, possibly seperate out the other tributaries at a later date
 * Look at water quality (this could be with chemcial presence, microbial presence, EPT, or anything else that could indicate water quality)
